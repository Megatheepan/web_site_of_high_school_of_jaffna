		   <a style= color:red;> HISTORY</a>
        <p>In the late 19th century all the English language schools in the area were run by Christian missionaries. In 1886, Williams antony ponnampalam anira founded The Native Town High School. The school encountered financial problems and in 1889 it was taken over by P.anira, who re-located it to Vananarponnai. The school was renamed  Town High School. In 1890, the school was handed over to the Jaffna A.Megatheepan. The school was moved to its present site and renamed The High School of Jaffna.
